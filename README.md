- _Assignments_ folder: contains a walkthrough of the course. It is divided into 4 modules:
  - _Basics_ folder: containing the assignments for the first module on Basic programming methods.
    - covers: Python language and main system modules, Python libraries for scientific computing, Tools for software management and documentation
  - _PP_ folder: containing the assignments for the second module on Parallel Programming
    - covers: Techniques and libraries for parallel and GPU computing
  - _CUDA_ folder: containing the assignments for the second module on Machine Learning
    - covers: Knowledge of fundamental concepts in machine learning and neural network development, Feed-forward networks, convolutional networks, and   recurrent networks, Generative networks (GANs and autoencoders), and graph networks. 
  - _HEP_ folder: containing the assignments for the second module on High Energy Physics Programming tools
    - covers: Specific tools for data analysis projects and applications in particle physics
- _Project_ folder: contains the walkthrough of my final project for the course.

Each folder contains a README file that goes through all the code files and results obtained.
